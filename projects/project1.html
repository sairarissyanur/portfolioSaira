      <h1>Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
      <p>
        This project involved the development of my personal web portfolio, aimed at presenting my background,
        technical competencies, and creative capabilities in a structured and accessible manner.
        The site is designed with an emphasis on clarity, responsive design, and professional tone.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of this project was to create a formal, job-application-ready website that would serve as a central point
        for showcasing my academic journey, design skills, and technical projects. The site functions as both a personal brand
        representation and an academic deliverable for my web design coursework.
      </p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I independently designed and developed the entire website, including layout planning, responsive structure implementation,
        and visual aesthetics. I also managed accessibility standards and site performance optimizations. From initial concept
        to final deployment, every aspect was handled individually.
      </p>

      <h2>Design & Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        The process began with content structuring and wireframe sketches, followed by full-scale implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I employed a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness across all devices. Dropdown menus, internal navigation, and interactive
        UI elements were added using vanilla JavaScript. The design language was chosen to reflect a soft, neutral color scheme,
        balancing elegance with clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The portfolio meets formal academic and industry expectations for professional presentation.</li>
        <li>All pages are responsive, accessible, and aligned with semantic HTML standards.</li>
        <li>Deployed via GitHub Pages, the site is now available as a live, shareable resource.</li>
      </ul>
