    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Saira Arissya Nur binti Muhammad Adlizan. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons) in Computer System Security at Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Information Technology (UniKL MIIT).
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey began in 2021, following my graduation from SMK Sri Hartamas with an SPM certification. Later that year, I enrolled in the Foundation in Information Technology programme at UniKL MIIT, which I completed over two years. This foundation strengthened my technical skills and led me to further pursue a degree in the same institution. I am now in the midst of completing my Bachelor of Computer Science (Hons.) in Cyber Security, a 3.5-year programme that has deepened both my technical and analytical capabilities.

    <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>
      My interest in cybersecurity was sparked by a growing awareness of digital threats, particularly online scams and hacking. I found myself fascinated by how these attacks work, what makes them successful, and most importantly, how they can be prevented. This curiosity evolved into a purposeful academic path where I now study the technologies and strategies involved in protecting information systems.

  <section class="about-skills">
    <h2>Designing in the Digital Space</h2>
    <p>
      While my primary focus lies in cybersecurity, I also possess a strong appreciation for digital design. My interest in web design began during a course that introduced the fundamentals of front-end development. With a background in traditional art forms such as sketching and painting, I found digital design to be an extension of that creative expression, offering structure and interactivity to the visual process.

  <section class="about-values">
    <h2>My Approach and Values</h2>
    <p>
      As a student and aspiring professional, I believe in continuous learning, adaptability, and precision. I approach every task with a sense of responsibility and a commitment to both clarity and quality. Whether solving a cybersecurity challenge or refining a user interface, I strive to balance technical accuracy with thoughtful execution.
    </p>

  <section class="about-personal">
    <h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of my academic and technical interests, I enjoy reading and listening to music, activities that offer a peaceful escape from the often overwhelming pace of life. I also find clarity and reflection through walking, especially when I need to regain focus or unwind. These hobbies help me stay grounded and maintain balance as I navigate both academic demands and personal growth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-future">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      While I am still exploring specific career paths, I have developed a particular interest in cybersecurity forensics. The investigative nature of this field appeals to me deeply, aligning with my fascination for criminology and problem-solving. I look forward to contributing meaningfully in roles that blend technical expertise with critical analysis.
